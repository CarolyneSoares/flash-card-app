## Flashcard Application

This is a flashcard application developed in Python using the Tkinter and Pandas libraries. The application helps users learn new words by displaying flashcards with words in English and their translations in Portuguese.

### Technologies Used:
- **Tkinter**: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and reading word data from CSV files.

### How It Works:
1. **Graphical Interface**: The GUI is created with Tkinter, setting up a main window with a specific background color and a Canvas to display the flashcards.
2. **Data Handling**: Words are loaded from a CSV file. If the `words_to_learn.csv` file is not found, it loads data from `planilha.csv`.
3. **Flashcards**: Each flashcard shows a word in English. After 3 seconds, the card flips to show the translation in Portuguese.
4. **Interactivity**: There are two buttons - one to indicate that the word is known (removing it from the list) and another to skip to the next word without removing it.

### Functionality:
- The application loads words from a CSV file.
- It shows words in English and, after 3 seconds, flips the card to show the translation.
- The user can mark words as known, removing them from the learning list.

Iâ€™m excited to keep developing this project and continue learning more about Python and GUI development! ðŸš€âœ¨
